Neutrino Platform Experimental Hall (EHN1)



The EHN1 extension is  dedicated to the Neutrino Platform and has been handed over from Civil Engineering (SMB) to the final users, in order to start the installation of the detectors and the related infrastructures.

In the 16-20 months after the handover an important activity of detector and infrastructure installation is present. The installation work will be organized in work packages, which need to be coordinated, planned and centrally supported. The detectors activities will be organized as detector infrastructure installation (cryostats, clean rooms, cryogenics, computing infrastructure, â€¦ ) and then as detector components integration, testing and installation. Two very different detector technologies will be installed and operated, as part of the DUNE prototyping activities (NP02 and NP04 CERN experiments). Infrastructure and detector components will be specific in most cases to each technology. Each work package will have its own internal organization and leadership.
